## Install tutorial

### Prerequisites
This is a texture pack **not** a server or a full LU client. You still need to get those to use this texture pack. The server I use is [uchu](https://github.com/yuwui/Uchu). For the texture pack you need specifically a unpacked client. The one I use is the [lcdr's unpacked client](https://mega.nz/file/zhRzBa4C#B5eY94-6vYmjJYqXkDXDM5hiqkPhZ7yb9ShCHG3Lgo8).

Before you continue, I'd recommed you to set up the server and the client.

### Future plan / what is included

#### Included

- A crosshair

- A Custom chatbox

- A Custom hotbat / skillbar

- A Custom chatbox and quickchat icons

- A Custom opendock icons

- A Custom Purgatory Realm style login menu

- A "VM" branded cape

#### Work In Progress

- A improved custom login menu

#### Future plans

- Custom clothes

- More colors for clothes

- Audio stuff (not likely as the audio is a whole new world of complicated)

(Note: If you have any ideas for what else I could change in the future send them them to me. I will notice them the fastest if you send them through discord)

### Actual tutorial

#### 1. Open the client folder and the texture pack folder

#### 2. Copy the texture packs res folder

#### 3. Paste the texture packs res folder into the where you have your client
If you are on windows you will be asked if you want to replace files. Say yes to all. I don't know how any of this works on linux or mac so you have to sadly figure this out yourself.
